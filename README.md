Just create an account and add contacts.
Cron is used as a scheduler for demo purposes, if need to upscale for larger user base a real scheduler engine would be used.

You can set preferences on when you want to be reminded by either clicking on the bell for individual reminders or the setting button on the top right.
Each account gets one test send for any contact they create.
