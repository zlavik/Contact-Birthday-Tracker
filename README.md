# Contact birthday reminder app
Link to see it in action: https://contact-reminder-2022.herokuapp.com/

This is for testing purposes only.
Just create an account and add contacts.

You can set preferences on when you want to be reminded by either clicking on the bell for individual reminders or the preference button on the bottom which sets it for all contacts. 

The send test reminder works but If you didn't receive an email it's because of existing issue.
